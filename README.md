## Summary
Farming Simulator is a 2.5D top down third person farming game. The objective is to grow crops and sell them to earn money. Crops are worth different amounts depending on the type of crop and the day that it sold, think like animal crossing turnip market. The farming aspect will work similar to harvest moon (at least the gbc version, I've never played any other ones lol).
